    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
    <p>Aspiring fullstack developer. I plan to work for <b>Google</b> eventually, but first I aim to work at a start up and have multiple side projects to test and work with new and upcoming technology and open-source code.</p>
    <p>I have an artistic and imaginitive mind so I love messing around with graphic designs and recreating inspiring art projects I've seen. It doesn't even have to be art related I always like to recreate baked goods or food to DIY woodcrafts.</p>

    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
    <p>I attended Baruch College originally for <b><i>Accounting</i></b> but I found my passion in computers and graduated with a BBA in <b><i>Computer Information Systems</i></b>.</p>
    <p>I've been working at my parent's family owned restaurant since graduating from college. Managing the books, inventory, employees, and filling in any position of staff depending on which department needs assisntance.</p>

    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
    <p>I love reading manga which are Japanese comics during my free time. I have a whole list of manga that I read every week on multiple websites for example <a href="https://readms.net/">mangastream</a> or <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">webtoons</a>      which update on a daily basis of manga or comics for readers to read for free.</p>
    <p>I also love to play video games, I think my first video game I ever played was Super Mario Bros. on the NES console. Ever since then even if I don't have time to play games because of work I will buy their products in support of the franchise. I collect
      multiple gaming titles for example:
      <ul>
        <li>Super Mario</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy</li>
        <li>Monster Hunter</li>
        <li>One Piece</li>
        <li>Megaman</li>
        <li>Legend of Zelda</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
